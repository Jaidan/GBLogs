### How to upload logs
All you need to do is find the 'GBLogs.lua' file in Wow-Directory\WTF\Account\[Account name]\SavedVariables and attach it to your message with the command ```%log```
- **WARNING:** The 'GBLogs.lua' gets bigger in size after each logging. Delete it from time to time to avoid unnecessary waiting while uploading it due to size.
